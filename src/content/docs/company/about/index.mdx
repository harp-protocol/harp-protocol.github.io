## What is HARP?

**HARP (Human Authorization & Review Protocol)** is an open, cryptographically verifiable protocol that ensures every AI agent action receives explicit human approval before execution.

As AI coding agents become increasingly autonomous — generating plans, modifying files, running commands, and deploying code — HARP provides the missing authorization layer: a secure, out-of-band mechanism for humans to review and cryptographically sign every action.

## Design principles

- **Open standard** — HARP is a protocol specification, not a product. Anyone can implement it.
- **Zero-knowledge** — The relay infrastructure never sees plaintext code or diffs.
- **Fail-closed** — If verification fails for any reason, execution is denied.
- **Interoperable** — Works with any AI agent, IDE, or mobile platform.

## Current status

<Callout variant="draft" title="Draft specification v0.2">
  HARP is under active development. The current specification (v0.2) is a standards-track draft. Normative language (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) indicates intended behavior for conforming implementations.

## Get involved

HARP is developed in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/harp-protocol/harp-spec). Contributions, feedback, and implementation reports are welcome.

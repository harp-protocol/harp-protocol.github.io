<Section title="The problem" description="AI coding agents are becoming autonomous — but approvals are still just UI buttons.">

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard title="Approvals live inside IDEs, terminals and servers" icon="warning">
    Today's control model: click "approve" in the same UI the agent controls. No cryptographic binding. No out-of-band verification.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="No proof of human intent" icon="lock">
    There's no way to prove that a human actually reviewed and approved what executed. Audits rely on timestamps, not signatures.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Enterprise risk grows" icon="building">
    As agents run migrations, deploy infrastructure, and modify production code — enterprises need governance, not just guardrails.

<Section title="How HARP works" description="Your AI agent asks. You approve from your phone. Execution only happens with your cryptographic signature.">

<Steps steps={[
  { title: "Agent creates an artifact", description: "The AI agent produces a plan, patch, command, or checkpoint describing what it wants to do." },
  { title: "Desktop encrypts & hashes", description: "The desktop enforcer canonicalizes the artifact, computes its hash, and encrypts it end-to-end to your mobile device." },
  { title: "You review on your phone", description: "Your mobile approver decrypts and displays the exact content for review — out-of-band from the IDE." },
  { title: "You sign your decision", description: "Approve or deny. Your device signs the decision (Ed25519), bound to the artifact hash, scoped and time-limited." },
  { title: "Desktop enforces", description: "The desktop verifies signature, hash match, expiry, and replay protection. Only then: execute. Otherwise: fail closed." }

<Section title="Why out-of-band matters" description="Authorization should happen on a device the agent cannot control.">

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard title="Separate trust boundary" icon="phone">
    Your phone holds the signing keys. The AI agent never touches them. Even a compromised IDE can't forge your approval.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Cryptographic binding" icon="key">
    The approval is mathematically bound to the exact bytes the agent proposed. Substitution after approval is detectable.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Zero-knowledge relay" icon="cloud">
    The gateway routes only ciphertext and metadata. It cannot read your code, inspect diffs, or forge approvals.
  </FeatureCard>

<Section title="What agents do that needs authorization" description="Every autonomous action becomes a reviewable, signable artifact.">

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="Plans & task bundles" icon="clipboard">
    Agent proposes a multi-step implementation plan. You review and approve the plan before any code is written.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Patches & diffs" icon="pencil">
    Agent generates code changes. You see the exact diff, approve, and only then is the patch applied.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Terminal commands" icon="bolt">
    Agent wants to run a shell command. You see the exact command, approve from your phone, and it executes.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Checkpoints" icon="rocket">
    Commits, pushes, deployments, migrations — each becomes a signed checkpoint with your cryptographic approval.

    Every decision is verifiable offline: what was proposed, who approved, when, and what executed.

    Define rules: require approval for high-risk operations, escalate for production deployments, enforce team-level governance.

    Cryptographic signatures, replay protection, scoped time-limited decisions, and tamper-evident logging.

  HARP v0.2 is a standards-track draft. Language like "MUST/SHOULD" indicates intended normative behavior. Do not treat as a finalized standard.

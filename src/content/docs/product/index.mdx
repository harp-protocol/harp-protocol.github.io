  title="The human authorization standard <em>for AI agents</em>"
  subtitle="AI agents are autonomous. HARP makes every action reviewable and every approval cryptographically verifiable — from a separate human-controlled device."
/>

## The problem

Today's AI coding agents can generate plans, modify files, apply diffs, run commands, commit code, and deploy infrastructure. But approvals happen inside the same IDEs, terminals and servers the agent controls — a button click with no cryptographic meaning.

**No binding between what was reviewed and what executed.** No out-of-band verification. No enterprise governance.

## How HARP solves it

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="Deterministic artifacts" icon="document">
    Every agent action (plan, patch, command, checkpoint) becomes a canonical, hashable artifact with a stable identity.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Out-of-band approval" icon="phone">
    Artifacts are encrypted end-to-end to a mobile device. The human reviews and signs on a device the agent cannot control.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Cryptographic binding" icon="pencil">
    The signature is mathematically bound to the exact artifact hash, scope, and expiry. Substitution is detectable.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Local enforcement" icon="shield">
    The desktop enforcer verifies everything locally before execution. If verification fails, it fails closed.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## What HARP prevents

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="Substitution" icon="shuffle">
    Approve A, execute B? Not possible — the Decision is bound to the artifact hash.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Replay" icon="refresh">
    Reuse an old approval? Blocked by nonce, expiry, and replay cache.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="In-band compromise" icon="desktop">
    Agent controls the IDE? Doesn't matter — signing keys are on your phone.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Enforcement bypass" icon="ban">
    Execute without verification? Blocked at the local enforcement boundary.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

<Callout variant="info" title="What HARP doesn't try to be">
  Not a UI standard for review screens. Not a full PKI — but it specifies key lifecycle requirements. Not a monolithic platform — integrate the pieces you need.
</Callout>

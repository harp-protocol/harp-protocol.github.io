## AI agent integration points

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="IDE extensions" icon="desktop">
    VS Code, JetBrains, or any editor with agent support. The desktop enforcer wraps every agent action as a HARP artifact.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Agent frameworks" icon="robot">
    Agents that emit plans, patches, commands, or checkpoints. HARP becomes the last-mile authorization gate.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Mobile approver apps" icon="phone">
    Custom or white-label mobile apps that decrypt, display, and sign HARP decisions. Your phone becomes the signing authority.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Gateway infrastructure" icon="cloud">
    Zero-knowledge relay services that route encrypted artifacts and decisions without seeing plaintext.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## Enterprise integration scenarios

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard title="Team-level governance" icon="building">
    Require senior approval for production deployments. Enforce multi-person review for high-risk operations.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Autonomous operations" icon="gear">
    AI agents running infrastructure changes, data migrations, or cloud operations — each action requires human sign-off.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Compliance & audit" icon="clipboard">
    Every approval is cryptographically verifiable. Audit trails are tamper-evident. Meet regulatory requirements.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="DevOps pipelines" icon="refresh">
    Gate deployment steps with HARP approvals. Approve from your phone while the pipeline waits.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## Deployment patterns

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard title="Desktop enforcer" icon="desktop">
    On the developer machine, integrated into the IDE. The primary trust boundary.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Sidecar / gateway" icon="box">
    In a server context for autonomous agents. Enforces decisions before actions reach production.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Managed relay" icon="cloud">
    Cloud-hosted gateway with device management, push notifications, and tenant isolation.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

<Callout variant="info" title="Key principle">
  Authorization happens on a device the agent cannot control. Enforcement happens at the point of execution.
